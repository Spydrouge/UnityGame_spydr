CubSub > Utility

* Purpose: This is a place for scripts that do not derive from MonoBehaviors, are not necessarily specific to edit time editors, and have utility, enum, etc. functionality. ie: Paths.cs, a tool for finding our way to saved data, is a resident of the Utility folder.

Notes:  
* Other libraries may not make a distinction between run-time and utility scripts, and may include them all under a generic 'Scripts' folder. Editor scripts are usually still seperate.
