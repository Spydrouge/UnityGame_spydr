CubSub > Play

* Purpose: This is a place for scripts that derive from MonoBehaviors and GameObjects and are expected to do their dirty work at runtime. They may often be edited with code in the Editor folder, or interact with tools/enums/etc from the Utility folder. 

Notes:  
* Other libraries may not make a distinction between run-time and utility scripts, and may include them all under a generic 'Scripts' folder. Editor scripts are usually still seperate.
