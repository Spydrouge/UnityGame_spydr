# CubSub > Editor  

* Purpose: This folder contains 'run at edit time' scripts that create windows, mendo options, and custom inspectors for us to work with Cubiquity and Substrate data.  

Notes:  
* In MonoDevelop's project explorer, usually these files are not visible under Assembly-CSharp, but are found under Assembly-CSharp-Editor instead.   
* Cubiquity also has a similar Cubiquity > Editor setup.
