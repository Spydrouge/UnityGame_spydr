	 * Volumes are probably the single most fundamental concept of %Cubiquity. They essentially provide a 3D array of voxels which the user can
	 * modify at will, and they take care of synchronizing and maintaining a mesh representation of the voxels for rendering and collision detection.
	 *
	 * The Volume class itself is actually an abstract base class which cannot be instantiated by user code directly. Instead is serves as a base
	 * for the ColoredCubesVolume and TerrainVolume and encapsulates some of the common behaviour which such derived classes need. It is used in
	 * conjunction with the VolumeData, VolumeRenderer and VolumeCollider to form a structure as given below:
	 *
	 * \image html VolumeComposition.png
	 *
	 * Note how this is conceptually similar to the way that Unity's mesh classes are structured, where the MeshFilter works in conjunction with 
	 * the Mesh, MeshRenderer and MeshCollider classes.

		 * %Cubiquity continuously checks whether the the mesh representation (used for rendering and physics) is synchronized with the underlying
		 * volume data. Such synchronization can be lost whenever the volume data is modified, and %Cubiquity will then regenerate the mesh. This
		 * regeneration process can take some time, and so typically you want to spread the regeneration over a number of frames.
		 *
		 * Internally %Cubiquity breaks down the volume into a number regions each corresponding to an octree node, and these can be resynchronized
		 * individually. Therefore this property controls how many of the octree nodes will be resynchronized each frame. A small value will result
		 * in a better frame rate when modifications are being performed, but at the possible expense of the rendered mesh noticeably lagging behind 
		 * the modifications which are being performed.

		 * that same value be used in edit mode vs. play mode? What if there is/isn't a collision mesh? Or what if we want to syncronize every 'x'
		 * updates rather than 'x' times per update?
